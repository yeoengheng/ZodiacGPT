2024's Chinese zodiac sign
On 10th February 2024, we move into the year of the Wood Dragon. The Dragon is the fifth animal in the Chinese zodiac and represents good luck, strength, charisma, and ambition. So, 2024 babies are expected to possess these traits!

Upcoming years will bring the year of the Snake on 29th January 2025, and the year of the Horse on 17th February 2026.

How does the Chinese zodiac work?
The animals of the Chinese zodiac are not associated with constellations in the sky. Its 12-part cycle corresponds to years rather than months (mirroring Jupiter’s cosmic path around the Sun, which takes 12 years), and the elemental aspect is used differently.

The Chinese New Year begins on the second New Moon after the Winter Solstice (this changes each year, so if you’re a January or February baby make sure you check which year you fall into) and each year comes under the influence of a different animal (see more on those below).

Origins of the Chinese zodiac system
One legend says that the origins of these animals’ selection came about because long ago, the Jade Emperor wanted to appoint 12 animals to be his guards. He sent an immortal being to Earth to spread the message, and put it out there that the earlier an animal got through the Heavenly Gate, the better rank it would receive.

So, the Earth’s animal kingdom embarked on a ‘race to the gate’- the first 12 were the first ‘knighted’. Rat was the smartest/fastest, and got there first. The rest came in the below order, and their stories kind of dictate the characteristics each are said to possess.

Since the Chinese zodiac cycle repeats every 12 years, it’s easy to figure out if it’s your year— just check if your age is a multiple of 12!

But your Chinese zodiac animal is not the only thing you need to know. Your birth year also corresponds to one of the five elements (metal, water, wood, fire, earth). In Chinese philosophy, these five elements are seen as the foundation of everything in the universe and all natural phenomena. They have their own characteristics, and which one you fall under determines your personality as well as your animal.

Finding your Chinese horoscope element
Discover your element by matching the last numeral in your year of birth to the element below:

0 or 1: Metal

2 or 3: Water

4 or 5: Wood

6 or 7: Fire

8 or 9: Earth

So, for example if you were born in 1990, your element is metal; if you were born in 1982, your element is water. To put it all together and discover your in-depth personality analysis, click here (all you need to provide is your birth date).
